<ol><li><span>Yes, I&#8217;m employed and very happy (and well compensated) at my job.</span></li>
<li><span>I was in the warehouse/trailer since August 1, 2012. The van since Aug. 1, 2013.</span></li>
<li><span>I shower at work.</span></li>
<li><span>I eat: 1.) non-perishables 2.) out a lot 3.) whatever I buy at the grocery.</span></li>
<li><span>What&#8217;s my plan for winter? Another down comforter and a warm hat.</span></li>
<li><span>I also go to the the bathroom at work, and yes, occasionally in an empty, sealed, jug.</span></li>
<li><span>Is the van down by the river? It is not.</span></li>
<li><span>How long do I plan to do this? We will see I suppose. May as well try it while I can. Let&#8217;s just say I have higher priorities than van living, and I certainly won&#8217;t let this get in the way.</span></li>
<li><span>How do I bring women back to my place? I don&#8217;t.</span></li>
<li><span>Where do I park the van? A downtown industrial area where nobody seems to mind.Â </span></li>
<li><span>Do I offer free candy? I do not.</span></li>
<li><span>Why? To see how little I can own and lead a normal, happy, life and answer the question: if you get rid of everything that doesn&#8217;t lend meaning to your life.. what do you have left?</span></li>
</ol><p>&#8230; there you go. Now we can talk about other things at parties.</p>
