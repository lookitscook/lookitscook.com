Switched from the super-toxic stuff to <a href="http://www.franmar.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=125&amp;products_id=75">Soy-Gel from Franmar</a>Â Costs about twice as much, but not having to worry about it being highly toxic (environment aside, it&#8217;s tough to do really hard scraping when you&#8217;re worried about getting it on your skin).</p>
